# Genetic Deep Learning
This project aims to use genetic algorithms to boost the learningof DNN.  Building and training a family  of NN with same structure and hyperparameters from scratchs but starting from diferent random weights.   After afew epochs, mate the trained weights together in order to produce the next generation.
